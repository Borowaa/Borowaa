🎯 Portfolio – Data Analysis & Game Development (MSc Informatics & Econometrics)

Hi, I’m Mateusz Borowczak — a data-focused MSc student in Informatics & Econometrics.
I specialize in data analysis, Python, and Unity-based simulations. My goal is to work in data analytics / business intelligence / data science, where I can apply both technical and analytical skills to deliver clear insights and reproducible solutions.

Focus areas: statistical analysis, data visualization, metrics design, telemetry, and applying AI-assisted workflows in research.

🔑 Highlights

Master’s Thesis Project: AI Re-Creation Study — Rebuilding a Human-Made Game with Generative Tools
Reproducing a released indie game in Unity using AI-assisted tools, then comparing time, cost, and quality with the original.
Why it matters: delivers measurable evidence on when AI tools are efficient—and when human input is essential.

Previous Work — “Green Horizon” (Mayor Simulator):
Co-developed a simulation game with a focus on economy balancing, system design, and analytics setup.

Analytical Toolkit from University Coursework:

SAP Fiori – basics of enterprise systems navigation and reporting

SAS / SAS Viya – fundamentals of statistical analysis and data processing

Excel VBA – introductory automation and macro creation

Technical Experience: Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn), Unity/C#, Blender, MATLAB (background), Postman (API testing), MongoDB (via Robo 3T).
🧪 Master’s Thesis — AI Re-Creation Study

Goal: Recreate a human-made game with AI support and evaluate:

Productivity: development speed and bug density

Cost: API/tool costs vs. manual effort

Quality: gameplay parity, performance, and asset fidelity

Maintainability: code complexity and future extensibility

Methods:

Telemetry tracking of playtests (session time, win/loss ratios, difficulty curves).

Data analysis with Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).

Code metrics and reproducible evaluation scripts.

📊 Example Analytics

KPIs: completion % per level, difficulty pacing, player churn estimates.

Dashboards: Jupyter notebooks generating reproducible visualizations.

Sample pipeline: scripts/evaluate.py → outputs KPI report in /reports/.

🧰 Tech Stack

Data & Analytics: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Jupyter, SAS (base, Viya) – basic, Excel VBA – basic
Enterprise Systems: SAP Fiori – basic
Game & Tools: Unity (C#), Blender
Databases: MongoDB (Robo 3T), CSV/Parquet
Other: MATLAB (numerics), Postman (API testing), Git
🤝 What I Bring

Strong data analysis skills with focus on clarity and reproducibility.

Ability to connect analytics with product outcomes (games, simulations, experiments).

Experience across multiple tools, from statistical software to databases and enterprise systems.

Team-oriented mindset — clear reporting, clean code, and communication of findings.
