## 🧪 Master’s Thesis — AI Re-Creation Study  

**Goal:** Recreate a human-made game with AI support and evaluate:  
- ⚡ Productivity: development speed & bug density  
- 💰 Cost: API/tool usage vs. manual effort  
- 🎮 Quality: gameplay parity, performance, asset fidelity  
- 🛠️ Maintainability: code complexity & extensibility  

**Methods:**  
- Telemetry tracking of playtests *(session time, win/loss ratios, difficulty curves)*  
- Data analysis in Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`)  
- Code metrics & reproducible evaluation scripts  

---

## 📊 Example Analytics  
- **KPIs:** completion % per level, difficulty pacing, player churn estimates  
- **Dashboards:** Jupyter notebooks generating reproducible visualizations  
- **Pipeline:** `scripts/evaluate.py` → outputs KPI report in `/reports/`
